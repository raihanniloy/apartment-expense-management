This application was developed using spring boot with thymeleaf on the front end. Postgres SQL was used for the database. Spring security was used for authorization and authentication. This application also provides rest endpoints for other 3rd party frontends like react or mobile apps. The rest endpoints are authenticated by JWT (JSON Web Token).
